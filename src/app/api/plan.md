let's discuss server actions, server components and api routes in order to implement functionality for the project.

projects: fetch all for current user, add project, update project, delete project
catalogues: fetch all catalogues + user specific catalogues, add user specific catalogue, update, delete
sessions: fetch all for current user, fetch all for current project, create a session, update, delete.

what are your thoughts?

i think api calls will be benefitial since i have plans on creating another client application for this project.

i would like to focus on data manipulation layer first. then â€“ getting information in the app.
zod and typescript.
